//TODO: Update the CLI to support the "up" arrow to cycle through previous commands
//TODO: Simulate battles between pokemon
//TODO: Add more unit tests
//TODO: Refactor your code to organize it better and make it more testable
//TODO: Keep pokemon in a "party" and allow them to level up
//TODO: Allow for pokemon that are caught to evolve after a set amount of time
//TODO: Persist a user's Pokedex to disk so they can save progress between sessions
//TODO: Use the PokeAPI to make exploration more interesting. For example, rather than typing the names of areas, maybe you are given choices of areas and just type "left" or "right"
//TODO: Random encounters with wild pokemon
//TODO: Adding support for different types of balls (Pokeballs, Great Balls, Ultra Balls, etc), which have different chances of catching pokemon
